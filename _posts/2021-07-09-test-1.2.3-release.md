Sigil-1.6.0 represents a mix of bug fixes and new features for both epub2 and epub3.

**New Features:**
* Find and Replace search targets expanded to include tabbed files, CSS files, OPF and NCX files
* Saved Searches now save full search Controls (mode, direction, options, and targets)
* Preview loading is now completely asynchronous with a loading progress bar and loading placeholder
* Merge will now automatically prevent duplicate ids
* Merge will automatically add ids are former file boundaries to prevent TOC, Guide, and href losses
* A new Xhtml Highlighter speeds up huge single file loading considerably
* Redesigned CodeView Spellchecking to bring it back to Sigil-1.3.0 speeds
* The External XHTML editor will now always pass along the OPF path and spine position 
       to simplify interface with PageEdit (use "Open With" if you want the old behaviour)
* Added PyQtWebEngine as a newly required python module for Plugins. 
       ie. Plugins now have access to browser functionality for implementing e-Readers, more complex guis.

**Bug Fixes:**
* Add Qt workaround for restoring Sigil window sizes when FindReplace left open on macOS
* Add missing tr() calls to the tooltips in the Special Character selection dialog
* Fix bug when all unused selectors are removed as in css stylesheet - adds a comment placeholder
* Make empty Nav have a title to help empty epub passing epubcheck
* Fix bug where fonts couldn't be previewed when a space was in the path
* Redesigned code to make Merging large numbers of files much faster (Thank you Tex2002ans)
* Fix bug in blank language field in Spellcheck Dialog (Thank you Tex2002ans)
* Fix use of different indentation of css via PR from BeckyEbook (Thank you)
* Fix typos in plugin framework guide (Thank you Doitsu)
* Fix hang on launch when opf manifested files exist inside the META_INF (Thank you un_pogaz)
* Fix Metadata Editor bugs related to alternate-script (Thank you Carmina16) (#613)
* Fix Metadata Editor bugs related to epub2 event dates (Thank you Octet-nl) (#616)
